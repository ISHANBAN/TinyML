# TinyMCU-ESP32-CAM-MODULE
It is a complete pipeline to train a compact CNN model using the TinyNAS architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Then a quantized TensorFlow lite model is produced which is then finally used to generate C++ code to deploy it onto the ESP32 CAM module. So at first the necessary libraries such as pyTorch, TensorFlow and ONNX  are installed. The MCUNet github repository is also cloned. Then the training dataset, CIFAR-10, is installed and pre-processed. The dataset is divided into training, testing and validation sets. The CNN model architecture is built and the model is trained. TinyNAS finds the most accurate model in terms of model accuracy and device constraints. The PyTorch model is converted to ONNX then to tensorflow and then to tflite. Then the C code of the model is generated. The model generated is of accuracy 80.92%, which is much more than MCUNet.
