# Wake-Word-Detection
It is a TinyML speech recognition code. It is mainly used for spotting keywords, such as yes or no, on microcontrollers such as, Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. A pre-trained tiny neural network is used for audio classification. A stripped-down version of Google Speech Commands is used to train the model. It can only classify the commands into four classes – yes, no, unknown, silence, but it can be expanded to lights off and on. This code accepts input, extracts features from the input, then generates and processes features of the model and then displays result. This code can also be implemented through other boards like SparkFun Edge, STM 32, ESP 32, of course with the help of microphone without any modifications in the code. This code can also be accessed through the examples of Harvard_TinyMLx package otherwise through the given GitHub link.
