#TinyML 
TinyML, or Tiny Machine Learning, is a self-explanatory term. It refers to implementation of different machine learning models on resource – constrained IoT hardware devices having storage within the range of few kilobytes. TinyML has vast applications widely spread across different domains such as – smart home, wearables, healthcare, wildlife, agriculture and industry. So, given its multidisciplinary nature, a survey on different workflows of TinyML through its different basic applications can be very helpful. It also focusses on different advances in this field such as TinyMCU, which are revolutionary and pathbreaking in the field of TinyML. So throughout this survey, we will firstly talk about different softwares available from the field off TinyML through some basic applications and about probable changes that can be made to that. Secondly, we will talk about its implementation on different hardwares and finally, we will discuss about the different advances that has been made lately in this field.
