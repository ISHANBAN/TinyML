# GSM-GPS
A GSM module is used to communicate through AT commands. A GPS module is used to know the location of the microcontroller. These two can be integrated together to create a mechanism to send the location of the microcontroller through SMS. But, here both the devices’ functionalities are kept distinct of each other. A SIM800L GSM module is used. Then a SIM card is inserted with the cut out facing the top left. The GSM module must be powered from a stable 3.7V–4.2V source. The ESP32 3.3V pin cannot power it directly. It also can’t tolerate the direct 5V. Replace the +91XXXXXXXXXX with the required number and the message will be received on the phone. Calls can also be made using the GSM module. 
Here, a NEO-6M module is used. The TinyGPSPlus package must be installed in the Arduino IDE. The initial GPS readings will take some time but after that it will follow the baud rate. Accurate readings will be received outside as GPS modules require clear skies.
