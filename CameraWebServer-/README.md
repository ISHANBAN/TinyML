# CameraWebServer-
It is an ESP-32 CAM live streaming video application. It converts the ESP-32 CAM module into a Wi-Fi webcam accessible through a browser. So, it provides real-time camera access over Wi-Fi. This video streaming can be used for developing real-time face recognition system with the help of a basic CNN model. It can be used in home security system, attendance application in various institutes or as a security measure in various apps. It captures video from a ESP32-CAM module and streams the video to a webpage hosted on ESP32 local IP. The browser interface allows changing resolution, toggling flash, face recognition and snapshot capture. It also nullifies the storage problem in ESP32 as the images can be stored in the local system after capturing them directly from the stream. This code can be accessed by downloading the Espressif package in Arduino IDE and then migrating to its CameraWebServer example or else through the link given above.
